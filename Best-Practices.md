# Best Practices

* __Work backwards__ -- In general, it's easiest to start in a recent time period and work backwards.
* __Work top down__ -- Start at the "top" level (land or admin-1) and work down in increasing detail.
* __Verify specific change dates__ on Wikipedia
* __The best sources__, in order of preference, are:
	1. Maps made at the time of the period (i.e. for making borders in 1910, a world or regional map made *in 1910*)
	2. Maps made or sourced from historians or professional cartographic institutions
* __Done is better than perfect__ (for now)
